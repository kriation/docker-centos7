# CentOS v7
This is a CentOS v7 image derived from the official centos:centos7.

I've decided to use the standard defined 
[here](https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/9277) for this image, and all
that are derived from this.

I couldn't find a CentOS image in the repository that was close to the 
base size (~224MB) to use as a foundation for other images. 
After the update, and the cleanup, this image is ~239MB.
